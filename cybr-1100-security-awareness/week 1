 **Case Project 1-1: Personal Attack Experiences**
I have personally feel for those fake free hacks for Minecraft when I was younger. But I figured out how to remove that file from the computer. 
It happened maybe when I was 8 and I wanted to have the better advantage to people, as well as show my friends what I did. 
It was a Torjan virus and I looked at the recent downloads and had task manager open to see why the fans where spinning so fast and found it that way. 
The computer was fine afterwards. What could've prevented it was me not falling for those types of scams. I think it was succesful, I did my best to remove the files from the computer.
